Features
Functional:
1)	User registration: The user will be able to create an account with unique personal information and linked with an email address.
2)	Schedule an appointment: There will be a user-friendly GUI that will allow the user to make an appointment based on date, preferred doctor, and time.
3)	Notifications and Alerts: There will be a system in place to send out push notifications to the userâ€™s email address to notify them of their appointments when they are made. There will also be alerts sent out for cancellations made by the doctor.
Non-functional:
1)	Database: There will be a database to store the userâ€™s account information and to hold the appointment information.
2)	Scalability: The app needs to be able to scale based on the number of users accessing it. The app needs to perform smoothly even under heavy loads.
3)	Security: As security is very important, there will be a need for layers of security. For example, there should be a two-step verification feature to provide adequate security to ensure the user their information is kept private.
